Scripts for the manuscript "Multi-method assessment of pubertal timing and associations with internalizing psychopathology in early adolescent girls"

Description of scripts so far:

Puberty_timing_all - combine all measures of pubertal stage, calculate residuals based on lm with age for first measure of timing

dynamic_timing_windows - also calculate dynamic timing windows as second measure of timing - individual's stage minus the mean stage of everyone +/- 6 months, i.e., age windows (repeated again for everyone in individual's grade, i.e. grade windows). Correlates the different methods of calculation.

timing_psychopathology_SCA - A specification curve analysis that includes various timing measures as predictors of cross-sectional and longitudinal psychopathology outcomes.
